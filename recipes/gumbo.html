	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>This a recipe for homemade Louisiana Gumbo</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>1 heaping cup all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>2/3 cup oil (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
	<li>1 bunch celery , diced, leaves and all</li>
	<li>1 green bell pepper , diced</li>
	<li>1 large yellow onion , diced</li>
	<li>1 bunch green onion , finely chopped</li>
	<li>1 bunch fresh chopped parsley , finely chopped</li>
	<li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
	<li>1-2 Tablespoons cajun seasoning *</li>
	<li>6-8 cups Chicken broth *</li>
	<li>12 ounce package andouille sausages , sliced into 'coins' (substitute Polska Kielbasa if you can't find a good Andouille)</li>
	<li>Meat from 1 Rotisserie Chicken*</li>
	<li>2 cups Shrimps , pre cooked</li>
	<li>cooked white rice for serving</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Make the Roux*: In a large, heavy bottom stock pot combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 30-45 minutes. This part takes patience--when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft, "cookie dough" like consistency. Be careful not to let it burn! Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency.</li>
	<li>Brown the sausage. In a separate skillet on medium-high heat place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate.</li>
	<li>Cook the vegetables in broth. Add ½ cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot. </li>
	<li>Add remaining 5 ½ cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley, garlic and roux to the pot and stir well. </li>
	<li>Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. (Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste. </li>
	<li>Add meat. Add chicken, sausage, and shrimp.</li>
	<li>Taste and serve. At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking--salt, pepper, chicken bullion paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth--until you reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day!)</li>
	</ol>
